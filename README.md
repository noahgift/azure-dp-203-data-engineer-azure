# Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Examples

This repository has information on the Microsoft Azure Data Engineer Certification [DP-203](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-203)
This exam covers the following skills:

* Design and implement data storage (40-45%)
* Design and develop data processing (25-30%)
* Design and implement data security (10-15%)
* Monitor and optimize data storage and data processing (10-15%)

## Design and implement data storage - Part 1

### Design a data storage structure

* design an Azure Data Lake solution
* recommend file types for storage
* recommend file types for analytical queries
* design for efficient querying
* design for data pruning
* design a folder structure that represents the levels of data transformation
* design a distribution strategy
* design a data archiving solution

### Design a partition strategy

* design a partition strategy for files
* design a partition strategy for analytical workloads
* design a partition strategy for efficiency/performance
* design a partition strategy for Azure Synapse Analytics
* identify when partitioning is needed in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

### Design the serving layer

* design star schemas
* design slowly changing dimensions
* design a dimensional hierarchy
* design a solution for temporal data
* design for incremental loading
* design analytical stores
* design metastores in Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Databricks

### Implement physical data storage structures

* implement compression

* implement data redundancy
* implement distributions
* implement data archiving

### Implement logical data structures

* build a temporal data solution
* build a slowly changing dimension
* build a logical folder structure
* build external tables
* implement file and folder structures for efficient querying and data pruning

### Implement the serving layer

* deliver data in a relational star schema
